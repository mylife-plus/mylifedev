## How we work

1. create a issue / bounty with name, with total mana , tag and task descriptions with time difficulty and mana
2. create a branch with the issue name and mark issue as in progress
3. make pull request with an updated issue if you realized that it took more or less time or new tasks where needed to solve the bounty
4. check and verify merge and add to the sheet and trigger mana transaction
