## How we work 

1.  admin creates a new issue/bounty by selecting the bounty issue template
2.  admin assigns bounty to bounty hunter and creates a new branch with the bounty name and mark bounty/issue as "in progress"
3.  bounty hunter makes a pull request with a comment, which is a copy of the bounty/issue description and updates it, if s/he realizes that the bounty took more/less time or new tasks where needed, to solve the bounty
4.  admin checks pull request, negotiates bounty time & difficulty with hunter and merges.
5.  admin updates google sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11CeTnguoBpilB2milc7fy2AIYvYmJVL7hsleEcyi3Fo/edit?usp=drivesdk and sends bounty mana reward to bounty hunter 

## How we will work 

1. anyone with staked project mana can create improvement proposals (IPs)(new features or fixing bugs) via comPower
2. project stakers upvote IPs. the more stake the more voting power
3. the top IPs get converted into Bounties by the elected dev contributors with the role "Bounty Creator"
4. Anyone can grab a bounty by locking 25% of the bounty mana behind it
5. once locked the bounty gets automatically assigned to the hunter. 
6. S/he has to finish the bounty in time. for every 3h bounty time the hunter gets 24h 
7. if the hunter fails to deliver in time s/he can extend by locking an additional 1/4 of the bounty price. the max extension time is 3x
8. if the hunter fails to deliver in time the mana gets burned and the bounty gets reopened 
9. once a bounty is finished the elected dev with role "Bounty Merger" checks and merges the bounty into main
10. once merged the bounty mana including the locked mana gets automatically send to the hunter
